[00:30.88] I tried an idea for no reason
[00:38.10] Keep the sun of my shoulders
[00:41.58] Crawling back to
[00:49.58] 
[00:45.78] A blackout
[00:50.15] Touching new life
[00:53.34] Face down
[00:58.79] Set the pace again
[01:06.14] Set the pace again
[01:15.14] 
[01:15.51] The drive, the idea still existing
[01:22.89] Sat and shuddered broke the pattern
[01:26.85] Falling inward
[01:30.52] In and down up and out
[01:34.02] Let it go, fall away back
[01:37.94] Call it off any day, anyway
[01:43.58] Make you feel this
[01:52.58] 
[01:45.54] A blackout
[01:49.98] Touching new life
[01:53.24] Face down
[01:58.34] Set the pace again
[02:07.34] 
[02:00.69] A blackout
[02:05.09] Touching new life
[02:08.45] Face down
[02:13.24] Set the pace again
[02:22.24] 
[02:24.32] Don't take the fall
[02:26.53] We'd hate to see
[02:28.66] That's entertainment
[02:31.55] Get some
[02:33.25] Eyes on the goal
[02:35.30] Last one to get
[02:37.46] Is passed over, looked over
[02:50.96] 
[02:41.80] Never rehearse
[02:44.19] They've spiked the water
[02:46.76] It's in the blood
[02:49.28] Get some
[02:50.67] We've underestimated
[02:54.92] How can I
[02:57.62] Get some
[03:01.62] 
[02:59.77] How can I
[03:01.96] How can I
[03:03.84] How can I
[03:06.66] Get some
[03:08.31] How can I
[03:10.66] How can I
[03:12.68] How can I
[03:15.16] Get some
[03:19.16] 
[03:25.05] A blackout
[03:29.43] Touching new life
[03:32.54] Face down
[03:37.90] Set the pace again
[03:46.90] 
[03:40.18] A blackout
[03:44.34] Touching new life
[03:47.79] Face down
[03:52.83] Set the pace again
[04:01.83] 
[03:55.08] A blackout
[03:59.41] Could this be the one
[04:02.36] A blackout
[04:06.35] Could this be the one
[04:09.56] A blackout
[04:13.72] Could this be the one
[04:17.06] A blackout
[04:21.03] Could this be the one
