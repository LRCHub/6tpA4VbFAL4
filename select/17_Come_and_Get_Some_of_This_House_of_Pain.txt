Step to this Irish mac daddy
I'll light your ass up
And smoke you like a fag
With the whole crew
We'll take you for a long ride
Little did you know
You on the wrong side, son
I got the gun and I'm not scared to use it
Put your life on the line
Homeboy you lose it
That how it goes, homes
I blow domes
When I rock mircophones
I can get swift to the riff from an old jam
I'm wise like an old man
And don't take shit from no clan
Or crew, or gang, or crew, or club
Wack MC's tryin' to rhyme it with my dub
**** the bullshit
The piece gets pulled quick
Fourteen pulls on my trigger
That's the whole clip
And if there's anyone still standin'
Thinkin' that they're runnin' shit
They can come and get some of this

[CHORUS]
Come and get some of this

Come and get some of this over here
If not
Stand clear and you got nothin' to fear
I'm livin' in a state of grace
And it's a ****** up place
I'll put my gun in your face
If you set up you'll get broke up
It's no joke, blood
I write rhymes, drink beer, fight, smoke bud
That's all I do
It's all I need
I buck down a little sucker
Just to watch him bleed
That's my style
It's how I do my thing
This is the House of Pain
And I'm the king
I come real with it
Can ya deal with it
Or will ya run for shelter
Though you barely felt the
House of Pain in full effect
And if you come with disrespect
You can come and get some of this

[CHORUS]
