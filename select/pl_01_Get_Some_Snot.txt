This sickness it burns inside me
It sticks in my throat I'm
gonna choke I cannot speak
Besides it runs the fear of the
unknown
Could this be some reckoning
Wrath for wrong I've done,
comin' back to haunt me
The God I have denied his power
shown
But now I can't protest
although defiant heart it
pounds deep in my chest
I know that this will have its
way with me
For now I choose to go
I know it's just the mind
tryin' to interrupt my flow
Intentions all fall down
My soul has died
Feed the greed, its not need I
figure so what
Can you fix the hole
that resides deep in this gut
Right now I need a drink so
I'll fix myself whatever it
takes I cannot wait
Now, this will not die they
warned me in church when I was
young I could rely
If there's a God, he's one I've
never seen
& now I just lament
Did not held the threat I
played the cards that I've been
dealt
Like putting out the fire with
gasoline
For when I used I lose won't
face the fear of life without
something abused
That now I'm forced to find
another way
My show your final show
A homicide I tried to warn, you
should have known
Now I'll take you with me
Show you my pain
Feed the need it's not greed, I
figure so what
You gonna tell me punk now
uh-huh
Can you fix the hole
that resides deep in this gut
I'll fix myself whatever it
takes I cannot wait
Come & get it, Come & get it,
get some
I feed the need that twists my
mind
Time & time again (gibberish)
Come & get it
