Everyone, everyday, looking for some, along the way
Sometimes you wonder why, it seems love just passes by
Sometimes you wonder when, love will pass your way again

But anytime, anywhere, you turn around and love is there
Someone with something new, right there in front of you
Someone with the stuff, you can't get enough of it?

Love, when love surrounds you

Go on, get some, take all that you're given
Just go on, get some
Get some of the love you're giving someone

Love, when love's around you
When love, when love surrounds you

Just go on, get some take all that you're given
Just go on, get some
Get some of the love you're given
Just go on, get some
Get some of the love you're giving someone
